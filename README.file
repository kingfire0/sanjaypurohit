# üöÄ Sanjay Purohit‚Äôs Tech Portfolio

Welcome! This is my vibrant, animated developer portfolio site‚Äîbuilt to showcase my work, creativity, and personality as a modern software developer and designer.

## üí° What is this?

This website is a personal, interactive portfolio you can visit online (deployed with GitHub Pages).
- **Live Demo:** [https://yourusername.github.io](https://yourusername.github.io) &larr; (replace this with your URL)

## üé® Features

- **Creative hero section:** Eye-catching animation, my profile image, and an engaging typewriter intro.

- **Jokes and Easter eggs:** Find playful touches and memorable design details throughout.
- **Responsive and animated:** Looks great and works smoothly on both computers and mobile devices.

## üëÄ Why did I build this?

I wanted to make a portfolio that‚Äôs more than a digital r√©sum√©‚Äîsomething unique, interactive, and enjoyable for recruiters and companies to explore. My goal: stand out with both my skills and creativity!

## üõ†Ô∏è How is it made?

- Fully custom HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript for effects/animations.
- No frameworks or build steps needed‚Äîall you need is this index.html (plus my profile photo).
- Hosted on GitHub Pages, 100% free & open source.

## üì∏ Can I use or customize it?

Absolutely! Feel free to fork, copy, or remix this for your own portfolio‚Äîjust replace my info and image with yours.
